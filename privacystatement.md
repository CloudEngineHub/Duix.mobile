**Last Updated:** 2025/06/09  
**SDK Name:** Duix Real-time Interaction SDK  
**Provider:** Duix.com Platform 

## 1. Introduction  
This Privacy Statement explains how [Duix.com] ("we," "us," or "our") processes user data through our open-source SDK when integrated into third-party applications ("Customer Apps"). The SDK enables real-time digital human interaction capabilities (voice/text).  

**Key Notes for Developers:**  
- **Compliance Responsibility:** Customers integrating this SDK must comply with applicable privacy laws and disclose our SDK in their privacy policy.  
- **Consent Requirement:** Customers must obtain valid user consent before initializing the SDK or collecting data.  
- **Minimal Data Collection:** We collect only essential data for core functionality and operational stability.

## 2. Data Collection & Purpose  

### A. Core Functionality Data  
| **Data Type**          | **Purpose**                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Audio/Text Input        | Process user queries to enable real-time digital human interactions.        |
| Interaction Metadata    | Maintain session stability (e.g., timestamps, session IDs).                  |

### B. Operational Data  
| **Data Type**               | **Purpose**                                                                 | **Retention**       |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Device Information<br>(e.g., OS) | Monitor SDK performance, diagnose errors, and improve reliability.          | 6 months            |
| Anonymized Usage Metrics<br>(e.g., feature adoption rates) | Optimize resource allocation and service quality.                            | Aggregated indefinitely |

**Note:**  
- Audio/text data is processed in real-time and **not stored** after session completion.
